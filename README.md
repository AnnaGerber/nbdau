# NodeBots Day Melbourne Resources

## General info:

**Date / Time:** Saturday October 12, 2013 (10am-6pm)

**Location:** York Butter Factory, 62-66 King St, Melbourne.

## Things to do before the day

The bottom of this doc has a list of software you should install as this will speed up the time it will take you to get running. 40 people all trying to download XCode (many multi GBs) at the same time will just slow everything down.

If you're keen on building a simple robot you can take home with you then you'll need some components. [We've got a handy list here of what you need and where you can get it.](simplebot.md)

## Setting up before you arrive:

If you have all of this installed before you arrive then you'll be ready to just get cracking on playing with hardware.

If any of this isn't working, don't worry, our friendly team will be able to help you on the day but it's important to have everything downloaded or you'll be waiting a while to get it onto your machine.

### Mac OSX

* XCode - Install from app store. If you have installed the Command Line Tools through another means (eg Homebrew) then you won't need to do this. This is big, you don't want to be doing this on the day or you'll miss out an hour of the fun.
* Development command line tools - Easiest way to do this is from xcode itself: [See thread here at StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools)
* Your choice of HomeBrew or MacPorts. We'd recommend [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) as it makes getting node up and running easy.
* NodeJS - [Follow appropriate directions here](http://nodejs.org)
* Arduino - [Mac Install guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
* Install the FTDI Drivers. You must do this if you want to use the ED1 boards. [32-bit Macs](http://www.ftdichip.com/drivers/VCP/MacOSX/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.dmg) or [64-bit Macs](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP/MacOSX/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.dmg)

### Linux

Install the following (assuming Ubuntu / Debian machines):

* Arduino [Available here to install manually](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux) or a simple 'apt-get install arduino' should do it
* NodeJS: [Source install instructions here](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs). Don't install via your package manager as you really need an up-to-date version of node to work with hardware.

### Windows

TODO as AJ doesn't use windows so needs some help.
